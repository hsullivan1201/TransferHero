# TransferHero

TransferHero is an attempt to use WMATA Metrorail API data to give riders more seamless information on transfers, using live data. This is inspired in large part by [MetroHero](https://github.com/jamespizzurro/metrohero-server), although this will be built from the ground up using Rust. Our main goal is to have fun and learn by building a fully functional webapp in a language that is new to us.

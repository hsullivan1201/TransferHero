# TransferHero

TransferHero is an attempt to use WMATA Metrorail API data to give riders more seamless information on transfers, using live data. This is inspired in large part by [MetroHero](https://github.com/jamespizzurro/metrohero-server).

# Status
TransferHero is in an early planning stage - planning details are located in the wiki. A basic prototype exists for simple display of trains.
